            I started reading a series when I was in high school. I really liked the author and their writing. I knew that the series was super long and would continue to grow as a tried to catch up. None the less I decided to start reading the series and really enjoyed it.

            I continued to read all of the books in the series. I believe it ended up being almost 20. Now I am kind of
            patiently waiting for the next book to be published. I am actually going to Toronto in october to see this author during their book tour. I am so excieted. They are introducing their new book series. The authors name is Cassandra Clare.
